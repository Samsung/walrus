WebAssembly spec tests from before the bulk-memory and reference-types
proposals were merged into the testsuite (as of commit a8bcbaf in
testsuite repository). The missing tests are tracked at
https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt/issues/1737

These files should be deleted once wasm2c supports bulk-memory
operations and reference-types.
